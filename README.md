# AgroTech---Smart-Agriculture-System-for-Sustainable-Farming
##Developed weather monitoring and agricultural automation  with ESP8266 microcontroller. 

## Introduction
-Here we introduce a smart weather reporting system over the Internet. Our introduced system allows for weather parameter reporting over the Internet. It allows the people to directly check the weather states online without the need of a weather forecasting agency. System uses temperature, humidity as well as rain with humidity sensor to monitor weather and provide live reporting of the weather statistics. The system constantly monitors temperature using temperature sensor, humidity using humidity sensor and also for rain. Weather monitoring system deals with detecting and gathering various weather parameters at different locations which can be analysed or used for weather forecasting. 

## Overview 
<kbd>Assemble all system as per circuit diagram. Program the NodeMCU using Arduino IDE. You will get
confirmation on your screen once The NodeMCU is a programable controller which has inbuilt wi-fi
module
We connect three sensors 1) BMP180 2) DHT11 and 3) Rain Sensor to NodeMCU. By using these
three sensors, we can collect the required weather data for monitoring purpose. This pooled data is
stream over the Internet to display it or read it from anywhere. After the successfully programmed
hardware, the NodeMCU get one IP address. We can browse this IP address from any of WEB
browser like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer etc.so we display the required live data which fetched
by sensors in beautiful Graphical User Interface format. The weather parameters that we monitor are
Temperature, Pressure, Humidity and Rain. Also, you can check whether data through anywhere using
Internet as we hosted this server publicly. We developed an android application for easy access to our
weather monitoring system.</kbd>
